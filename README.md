This project is a simple React dashboard with a sidebar and welcome screen.
It was bootstrapped using Create React App and styled with Tailwind CSS.


## Setup

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
Tailwind CSS is preconfigured so you can immediately use its utility classes.
